# Welcome to OceanHub[BETA]

This is early production of project OceanHub, and is not finished yet. If you happen to download, compile and run the project you will see horrible bugs. Therefore, I will reprogram the whole server but I wanted to share the project anyway.

In order to run the project properly you will need two API keys, one is for Google Maps API and the other one is for MongoDB. It's free to get both of them however the Google Services require 'pay as you go' method. So you will need to give your credit card info to get the API key and enable the services. You will get 300\$ (only to spend for Google Services) for 90 days.

I didn't use the npm package "concurrently" for this one so you will need to open two terminals, open the directories for both files and run the respective scripts to run the project. The scripts and proxy are set so you can see them rightaway inside Package.json file.
